#### Loss functions vs Metric functions
I like the phrasing in this [SO](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/47012/74450) answer, that loss functions are _optimized directly_ when training but that metrics are _optimized indirectly._ I was trying to figure out last year why functions commonly used as metrics (F1 and AUC) are not listed in the tensor flow [keras loss functions](https://keras.io/api/losses/) . I did however [earlier](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-06-23-today.md) try using F1 as a loss function when trying to understand my particular problem. _(At least one error I ran into hints that it is not that simplle because you need to write extra code for computing the gradient.)_ But even if you can produce the code to compute a gradient for your custom loss function, maybe some metrics are more expensive to run  SGD than others. (Also F1 is clearly less sensitive than a function that uses probabilities or logits directly) .
